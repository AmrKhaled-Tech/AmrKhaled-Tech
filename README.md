### 💡 Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced Android development capabilities, moving beyond simple UI to handle background services and system-level broadcasts. The app provides users with real-time tools to manage their device performance and connectivity.

### ⚙️ Technical Key Features
Instead of standard libraries, this app utilizes custom implementations for maximum efficiency:

* **Native Java Architecture:** Built entirely in Java for robust performance and memory management.
* **Background Services:** Implemented persistent `Services` and `BroadcastReceivers` to keep tools running even when the app is minimized.
* **Custom UI Components:** specific `RecyclerView` adapters with optimized layouts for smooth scrolling.
* **AdMob Integration:** Smart implementation of Banner and Interstitial ads (AdMob) ensuring high fill rates without disrupting user experience (UX).
* **Network Logic:** Advanced handling of connectivity states and data usage monitoring.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (Android SDK)
* **Architecture:** MVC Pattern
* **Data Storage:** SharedPreferences & SQLite
* **Monetization:** Google AdMob SDK
* **Compatibility:** Android 8.0 (Oreo) to Android 14

### 🔒 Source Code
*This is a closed-source commercial project.*
However, I am open to discussing the architecture or providing snippets regarding specific modules (e.g., the AdMob integration logic or Background Service handling) for verified opportunities.
